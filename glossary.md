We need to add the term ASIC to the vocabulary

Can Terry be included.....

We hope that this glossary of definitions is helpful as you study OpenStack, as well as the other topics found in this manual. Our glossary began with a fork from the OpenStack documentation. Many helpful OpenStack definitions (and documentation) are available through docs.openstack.org, or by forking the openstack/openstack-manuals repository via:

6to4 - A mechanism that allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an IPv4 network, providing a strategy for migrating to IPv6.

- **Aardvark** - The latest addition to the OpenStack service catalog, this service provides formally verified computations on unstructured data in linear time (as a Service) through the advanced use of string-theory based, quantum wormhole colliders. Specialized hard ware is required. It is a very useful feature, but not yet in the training course.
- **Absolute Limit** [6] Ceiling (limits) for guest VMs. Controlled by defining total limits on RAM, number of vCPUs, and disk size.
- **Active Passive Configuration** [19] In a high-availability setup with an active/passive configuration, systems are set up to bring additional resources online to replace those that have failed.

- **API** [1] Application Programming Interface. A collection of specifications used to access a service, application, or program. Includes service calls, required parameters for each call, and the expected return values.
- **API Endpoint** [1] The daemon, worker, or service that a client communicates with to access an API. API endpoints can provide any number of services such as authentication, accounting information, performance metrics, compute (nova) VM instance commands, population density of European & African Swallows anything!
- **API Key** [5] A term sometimes used to describe an API token.
- **API Token** [5] Passed on API requests and used by OpenStack services to verify that this particular user is authorized to access and run the requested operation.

Atest [5] This is a test.
- **Austin** [1] The first release of OpenStack was called Austin. Unsurprisingly, the first design summit took place in this capital city of Texas. OpenStack versions are short lived, and the release dates are aggressive (about 2 new releases a year). Generally, a customer will fork an OpenStack release version, and stick with it.
- **Authentication Token** [5] The identity service (Keystone) first confirms the identity of a user, process, or client; authorized because they've provided a private key, token, password, fingerprint, or similar security mechanism. The authentication token is a string of text returned to the user that is then included with a subsequent API request.
